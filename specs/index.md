# Specs Index

A schema-first, wide-event observability stack for Rust services. The
goal is **`tracing`-class ergonomics** with **compile-time schema,
cardinality, and classification safety**, **first-class OpenTelemetry
integration**, and **first-class analytics**, so a single emission
point doubles as a log line, a metric data point, a trace span, and
an analytics row in a unified columnar table.

Stack: `buffa` for wire types, `buffa-reflect` for schema introspection,
the `Obs*` event-name convention, single sparse `obs_events` analytics
table, and a Rust-only toolchain in v1.

The specs are numbered to reflect the **build order**. Reading them
top-to-bottom matches the milestone progression in [90-roadmap.md](./90-roadmap.md):
M0 covers 10–13, M1 closes 12 and adds 60/72, M2 covers 20 and parts
of 30/71, M3 closes everything else.

## Examples

Three runnable apps under [`/examples/`](../examples/) demonstrate
the SDK end-to-end against the surfaces specs 60 § 13 promises:

- [`http-service`](../examples/http-service/) — axum + obs-tower W3C
  traceparent propagation + OTLP/gRPC log exporter (tracing surface).
- [`batch-pipeline`](../examples/batch-pipeline/) — ETL pipeline
  emitting LOG + METRIC events to a `ParquetSink` (analytics surface).
- [`worker-pool`](../examples/worker-pool/) — worker-pool simulator
  emitting MEASUREMENT-flagged fields to `OtlpMetricSink`
  (metrics surface).

## Naming conventions (binding)

- Public Rust namespace: `obs::*`
- Public proto namespace: `obs.v1`
- CLI binary: `obs`
- **Event message names: `Obs<EventName>`** (enforced by lint L011;
  see [10-data-model.md § 7](./10-data-model.md#7-naming-convention-obs-event-types))
- Envelope field names use short forms: `ts_ns`, `sev`, `service`,
  `instance`, `version`, `format_ver` — see
  [10-data-model.md § 6](./10-data-model.md#6-envelope)

Where these documents refer to "the runtime", they mean the collection
of crates listed in [61-crates-and-features.md](./61-crates-and-features.md).
